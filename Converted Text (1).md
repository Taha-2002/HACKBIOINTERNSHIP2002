BREAST CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY

Breast cancer occurs when the breast tissue gets affected. Usually, it affects the lobules that generate milk or the cells lining the milk ducts. It is the most prevalent cancer among women globally, though it can also occur in men, but at a much lower frequency. Although the treatment is same for men and women. Breast cancer epidemiology means the incidences, the prevalences and the distribution of deaths all over the year. The disease occurs most commonly in developed countries such as Europe and United States of America due to the lifestyle changes. **<!--[if supportFields]><span

There were almost 2.3 million people deaths of the breast cancer in the year **2022** **<!--[if supportFields]><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span

Almost 13% of the women in the United States might get breast cancer over their lifespan. In recent years, incidence rates have gone up somewhat, about 0.5% every year. About 66% of breast cancer cases are found at an early stage, when the cancer is still within the breast and hasn't spread. This is the stage when treatment is most effective. Today, more than four million women in the United States have diagnosed breast cancer. This includes women who are currently in treatment and those who have finished it.

The median age when women are diagnosed with breast cancer is 62. There are several key risk factors for breast cancer to keep in mind. The main risk factors for this type of cancer are being female and aging. If a woman has a close family member, such as her sister, mother or daughter, who had breast cancer, her risk gets multiplied. About 15% of women with breast cancer have a family member who also had the disease. Genetics play an important role in developing a breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. This comprises people with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations. **CRISPR-Cas9** can be used to disable particular genes linked to the development and progression of breast cancer.

**Mammography** has evolved immensely for the screening of breast cancer. **Digital mammography** provides high-resolution images that help detect even the slightest abnormalities. Liquid biopsies are possibly the most innovative technique for early detection. These methods not only eliminate the need for unwanted treatments, but also provide a full view of tumor features, allowing for more tailored treatment recommendations.&#x20;
